            <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Cantanzaro herbs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cups orzo pasta</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, cut into short, thin strips</li>
            <li>1 (5.2 ounce) package BoursinÂ® Garlic and Fine Herbs Cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped spinach</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><h2>Step 1</h2>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Season both sides of chicken breasts with Cantanzaro herbs and salt.</li>
            <li><h2>Step 2</h2>Heat olive oil and butter in a deep dish cast iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken in a single layer, and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and keep warm.</li>
            <li><h2>Step 3</h2>Add shallot and garlic to the same skillet. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add orzo and stir to coat with oil.</li>
            <li><h2>Step 4</h2>Stir in chicken broth, milk, and whipping cream; stir in sun dried tomatoes. Nestle Boursin cheese wheel into the orzo mixture in the center of the skillet. Add chicken back to the skillet; cover.</li>
            <li><h2>Step 5</h2>Bake in the preheated oven until orzo is tender with a bite and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li><h2>Step 6</h2>Move chicken to the side, and add in the spinach. Stir until spinach wilts, about 1 minute. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
